Drag and Drop: With Taskflow, you can easily drag and drop tasks between lists and boards, making it easy to prioritize and reorganize your tasks.

Team Members: You can easily invite team members to join your workspace, allowing them to collaborate with you on tasks and projects.

Member Roles: Taskflow offers a range of member roles, from admin to viewer, allowing you to control who has access to what information.

Custom Board Background: You can customize your workspace by adding a custom board background, making your workspace more personalized and enjoyable to work in.
